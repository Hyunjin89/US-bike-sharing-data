## US bike sharing data ##

In this project, I performed an analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. I also tried to find if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
